        <h2>Design Process:</h2>
	
	<h3>Design Problem:</h3>
	<p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, a vast majority of office jobs have transitioned from in-office to a remote setting to 	prevent the spread of the virus, ensure the safety of the employees, and abide by the federal and state government safety mandates. 	This transition from an office setting to a work-from-home environment has affected the lives of remote employees beyond their 9-5 	responsibilities. Using this dataset, we seek to better understand how a remote work environment has affected the individuals 	surveyed on both a professional and personal level through visualizing the data. This visualization will provide insight into the 	factors that influence an employee’s success in a remote work environment.</p>
	
	<h4>Initial Questions:</h4>
	<p>	1.Which professions prefer WFH over WFO?
		2.Is the distribution of age uniformly distributed for WFH preference?
		3.Is there a correlation between parenthood status and WFH productivity
		4.What factors influence WFH creating a better work/life balance?
		5.For an individual that identifies as “stressed”, what attributes from the dataset could be considered to be influencing 		these feelings of stress?
		6.Could stress be leading individuals to feel that they lack the ability to engage (i.e. laziness/quality time)</p>

	<h5>Datasets:</h5>
	<p>This dataset was collected from Kaggle, an open-source data repository. We searched extensively online for a dataset regarding 	work from home and its impact on employees, but this survey dataset of 200 observations had the richest feature set and will 	provide the best visualizations. The dataset includes 18 survey questions and responses from 207 participants in the study. This 	will be used to create our visualizations and we will properly cite this source on our visualization webpage.

	<h5>Method Overview:</h5>
	<p>The team planne to use d3.js and CSS/HTML styling to allow for a user to have an interactive and user-friendly experience with 	the visualizations. The team wanted to ensure that the user is able to see exactly what they want to within the visualization based 	upon their interests and any questions that they may have in regard to the dataset. The team tried to make it clear the experiences 	that individuals have with WFH versus WFO and how these experiences affect them both during and before/after their time at work. We 	achieved this by creating interactive visualizations, in a (linked) multi-view form, that can be filtered and manipulated based on 	the available features in the dataset to further explore and analyze the data.</p> 	
	
	
	<h6>Design Sketches:</h6>
        <p>The following design iterations were made to better understand how best to visualize our data and answer our design 	questions.</p>
        <h7>Design 1</h7>
        <p><img src="./Project 2 Vis Sketch1.jpg" width="640" height="445" /></p>
        <p>
            The first sketch from Aleks Weber looked at breaking down visualizations into six seperate blocks that allow for visual 	organization and prevent overload of data and help with user flow.  Each design would feature the design question above it and a 	quick explanation of the data below it.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h7>Design 2:</h7>
        <p><img src="./Project 2 Vis Sketch2.jpg" width="640" height="445" /></p>
        <p>
            The second sketch from Matthew Mills data into three main sections with one main design visualization as the focal point and 	feature the most interactivity. The design would also feature smaller visulizations such as a box and whisker plot and combine the 	documentation page to make the website contents all fit on one page.
        </p>
        <h7>Design 3:</h7>
        <p><img src="./Project 2 Vis Sketch3.jpg" width="640" height="445" /></p>
        <p>
            The third design was done by Derek Kendall on Figma and features six blocks of visualizations of various types of graphs, 		charts, and plots.  There is also a main visulization that would be a pie chart with interactivity by age, industry, and 	profession.        </p>
	<h7>Design 4:</h7>
        <p><img src="./Project 2 Vis Sketch4.jpg" width="640" height="445" /></p>
        <p>
            The fourth design was done by Andrew George and features a tab banner that will allow user to click between viewing the 	visualizations, about section, and the video describing the website. The main page would feature a brief introduction of 	information, a scatter plot to represent most of the data in an interactive way, and a basic bar graph to show basic aggregated 	data. This design was chosen to represent our final product as it balances simplicity with informative and interactive data that 	does not overwhelm the user nor does it allow for potential navigational error.
